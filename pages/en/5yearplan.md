# Luxembourg's five-year road map for Open data

*Last update: 14/12/2022*

The official version of this document is the [French version](/fr/pages/5yearplan/).

In the field of Open data, the general objectives over the next five years are as follows
- Ensure, in the light of the [Open data Act](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2021/11/29/a836/) and the [Freedom of Information Act](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/09/14/a883/jo), that more data is opened up by providing technical and legal assistance to data owners to publish their data. The focus will be on the following topics
      - file formats, standards, automation of data publication;
      - decision support for licensing;
      - data protection considerations.
- Promote the publication of higher quality and easier to use Open data.
- Collaborate with the Luxembourg government's interoperability programme to encourage the publication of data in standard and interoperable formats.
- Collaborate with the Luxembourg government's AI4Gov programme to foster the availability of open datasets that can be used for AI.
- Collaborate with the ecosystem established under the Data Governance Act (re-use of certain categories of protected data held by public sector bodies).
- Organise events: 
      - Collaborative hackathons on a given theme;
      - Training for public sector employees;
      - Awareness-raising events.
- Improve the quality and currency of metadata through awareness campaigns and audit procedures. Quality metadata allows data to be found more easily by users of the Open data Portal.
- Recurrent monitoring of data and metadata quality and of the activity of organisations in the field. Present monitoring results in a public dashboard.

## Objectives per year
For each year, intermediate objectives or main topics are defined.
### 2023
- Carry out a study on the strengths and weaknesses of the national portal (survey on the knowledge of Open data among the general public, study on the satisfaction of the users of the portal).
- Optimise the search function of the portal and improve the quality of the metadata available on the portal.
- Establish lists of existing data that still need to be opened and allow citizens to submit ideas for new data to be opened.
- Specifically include more geographical data, from Luxembourg and the Greater Region, health data and data on parliamentary activity.
- Establish and update a list of data identified as high value-added datasets.
- Develop the concept of Open data officers in all relevant organisations and set up a network of such officers to promote the exchange of good practice.

### 2024 
- Develop a sustainable community around the Open data Initiative, consisting of active public sector organisations, citizens, non-profit organisations and businesses. The aim of this community is to provide feedback to data producers, to increase the visibility of interesting datasets and re-uses, to develop new re-uses and mutual support.
- Improve the availability of environmental data.
- Establish and update lists of existing data that still need to be opened.
- Update the list of data identified as high value datasets.
- Real-time data:
      - promote and increase the visibility of real-time datasets and reuses on the portal;
      - identify strategic real-time data that has not yet been published and support its implementation and publication;
      - organise an event to raise awareness of real-time data: added value for end-users, success stories, links to the Internet of Things, technical architectures, interoperability and standards.

### 2025 - 2027
- Increase automation of repetitive management tasks to improve metadata quality.
- Increase the use of web-based data harvesting to automate the recurrent publication of machine-readable data.
- Develop a label/brand for applications reusing Open data and launch a promotional campaign.
- Update the strategy and roadmap based on the activity review.
