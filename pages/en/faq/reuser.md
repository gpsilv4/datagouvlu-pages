Discovering OpenData as a reuser
==============================================

What is a re-use of public data?
------------------------------------------------------

The PSI Directive and its transposition into Luxembourg national law provide for the possibility of re-using information that public bodies collect and produce in order to fulfil their public service mission, for purposes other than those for which it is held or produced. If obtaining this information entails a cost for the administration (research, automated processing, etc.), the latter may request payment of a fee within the limits set by Luxembourg law.

### The interest of re-using open public data

The diversity of the fields of application of the open data policy is quite wide. By reusing public data sets, anyone can create applications, services or interactive data visualisations. These reuses allow, for example, to improve the action of a public service or to solve a problem.

### The format of re-uses on "data.public.lu

The reuses published on "data.public.lu" can be files downloaded directly (maps, tables, graphs, etc) on the website or links that redirect the visitor to see the reuse (to the website of start-ups, the AppStore, GooglePlay, etc).
