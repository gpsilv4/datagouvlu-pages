Discovering OpenData as a producer
===========================================

Who is considered a data producer?
-----------------------------------------------

The producer of a database, understood as the person who takes the initiative and the risk of the corresponding investments, benefits from a protection of the content of the database when the constitution, the verification or the presentation of the latter attests to a substantial financial, material or human investment.

This protection is independent of and without prejudice to those resulting from copyright or any other right in the database or any of its constituent elements.

### Certified public services

Organisations registered on the "data.public.lu" platform that consider themselves to be carrying out a public service mission can apply to be recognised as such. A certified organisation benefits from better referencing.

What is a dataset?
-----------------------------

A dataset can contain several resources (data files, explanatory files, APIs, links...) which constitute a coherent batch on a given theme.

How can I, as a producer, publish datasets?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Create an account on data.public.lu. As soon as you are registered, you can "contribute" and "publish a dataset".

A dataset can be published simply with a title and a resource. However, it will be better referenced if it contains additional information describing it: period covered, frequency of update, territory covered, themes...

What measurement tools are available?
---------------------------------------------------

On the engagement side, the producer dashboard (example) measures activity in terms of page views and reuses. The number of open discussions and the number of replies will be associated with it, as well as elements of comparison with other producers. The community's commitment is not an end in itself, but an indirect measure of its activity. It responds to a strong internal challenge: to limit our support actions to allow actors to solve their problems among themselves.

What do the different fields in a dataset sheet mean?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Title (mandatory)

The title is the editorial "hook" of your content, its subject. Think about it. It must be clear, precise and as short as possible. Do not put any time or geographical indications in the title, but in the fields provided for that purpose.

### Description

This is where the dataset should be highlighted, citing the facts, the keywords it covers, the sources and the methodology used... To write a good description, you should think like a search engine: which questions asked by Internet users should lead to this dataset? Example: for environmental impact, cite the keywords tonne-carbon, environmental externality, main negative and positive factors of the impact of mines on the environment, etc.

### License

Select the Open Data license under which you are publishing the dataset. In most cases, CC0 is recommended.

### Update Frequency

The frequency indicates the level of temporal detail within this period: indicate "month" if your file details month-by-month changes. If your information flow is updated annually, indicate "year".

### Temporal coverage

Just like the geographical coverage, the temporal coverage allows you to correctly reference the period covered. If it is a single year, indicate the same year for the beginning and end. If it is a school year, feel free to indicate 1/9/2013 to 31/6/2014 for example.

### Spatial coverage

This field should describe the territory covered and will allow for correct geo-referencing.

### Spatial granularity

Specifying the granularity makes it possible to specify whether the dataset is very aggregated (for example coverage = Luxembourg, granularity = Luxembourg), or on the contrary very detailed (coverage = region, granularity = municipality, or even point of interest at address level).

### Keywords

Keywords allow cross-browsing, i.e. a user browsing a dataset with the keyword "mines" is likely to click on this keyword and find another dataset with the same keyword. If you fill in this field, the rule is therefore to use keywords that have already been used by other datasets.

### Visibility

Selecting "private" allows you to save a set without it being visible. This can be useful when you want to publish several games on a given date, having prepared their publication in advance.

If you have filled in the form correctly and you want your data set to be visible on the site, do not tick the box.

### Resources (1 required)

The resources of your dataset. If your dataset concerns several departments or several years, it is possible to publish as many files as you wish. However, be aware that from the point of view of re-users, it is **always preferable to publish the densest files possible**: a file containing in column 1 the department, in column 2 the year and all the data thus classified, rather than 100 files per department, then as many per year.

Each resource has a **title**, in which it is best to **specify the criteria, units, granularity that best describes the resource**, rather than repeating the title of the dataset to which it belongs. For example:

* Detailed file of legal entities, by department and by year
* Statistical file by department, in k€ and in Tonne/Carbon
* Website allowing to select data by city and by type of journey

  
A **description** of the resource can be added optionally to express additional information on the methodology (survey, poll, tax data ..), details on the data in question (columns of the file ..), or any other information strengthening the title.

### Download a file or enter its URL?

If you do not have a website and your data is not updated very often, data.public.lu allows you to download files from your computer. However, if you have a website, it is better to reference your data, thus avoiding having to update it regularly on data.public.lu. For example, referencing the resource http://monsite.lu/jeu\_de\_donnees\_derniere\_version.csv allows you to declare a data item once and for all with a real time update frequency.

### Office, department or service

Specify here, as an option, the details of the organisation actually producing the data.

### Contact email

Optionally specify here the email address of the producer, if different from that of the publishing user. When you publish a dataset on behalf of an organisation, all declared members will be automatically notified of possible reuses on the dataset page (e.g. publication of a visualisation or a comment).

### Thematic (groups)

Just like keywords, which allow you to link your dataset to other dimensions, themes are available to anchor your datasets in the major editorial categories presented next to the search engine: Economy and employment, Environment, Energy, Transport, etc.
