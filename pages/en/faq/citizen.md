Discovering OpenData as a citizen
========================================

What data are published on "data.public.lu"?
----------------------------------------------------

As part of their public service mission, many administrations collect and store data of a very diverse nature. The State thus has a considerable amount of non-sensitive data such as

* Geo-spatial data in various fields: address points, land registry, topography, tourism, spatial planning, agriculture, archaeology, etc.
* Environmental data: meteorology, water quality, energy consumption, emission levels, etc.
* Public health data: sentinel surveillance of influenza, pollens, morphological register of tumours, activity reports etc.
* Road data: traffic, public transport timetables, location of construction sites, etc.
* Statistical data: demographic, micro-economic and macro-economic data.

"Data.public.lu" also aims to be a tool available to citizens to enable them to produce, enrich or complete this data or to share data of public interest, whether it be, for example, the inventory of a municipal library, the nutritional composition of food products or the environmental balance sheet of a company.

Personal data and data whose publication contravenes the law are not accepted on the platform.

For more information on best practice in publishing, see the Publication Guide.

### The benefits of publishing and sharing data

For a public service: opening up and sharing public data contributes to accountability in the functioning of institutions and encourages innovation. "Data.public.lu" strengthens the visibility of data by referencing it nationally and provides tools that facilitate conversations with each community gravitating around the public service (associations, journalists, researchers, students, citizens, etc.).

For an individual, a company, a researcher, an association: producing data of public interest, publishing them in Open Data and sharing their interpretations with the public enriches the public debate and strengthens freedom of information.

Through the publication of this data - which represents a genuine intangible national heritage - on a federating platform, it can be enhanced by the whole community:

* Citizens can find information enabling them to make informed decisions (location of crèches, bus schedules);
* researchers can directly access accurate information to support and deepen their academic work and scientific research
* IT developers can combine several datasets (e.g. geolocation of stops, kerb heights) in order to develop innovative services or mobile applications that can for example facilitate access to public transport for people with reduced mobility;
* companies can provide added value to this data, and thus create employment and wealth for the community. Representing the raw material and a growth vector for the entire economy, this data contributes to the development of new start-ups specialised in data processing, data visualisation, geomarketing, Big Data etc.
* the State, thanks to Open Data, can improve its functioning (decompartmentalisation, better management of public policies, etc.). Through the publication of certain data, public players encourage transparency and citizen participation in public affairs.

### The interest in reusing, enriching or completing data:

When a continuous, temporal and geographical data set is created, new uses and value creation occur. Whether they are interpretations (graph, map, animation, blog post) or applications (website, business software), reuses exploit the potential of Open Data.

The quality of the data, i.e. the temporal length of the series, their density and geographical coverage, and their frequency of updating, is the main key to determining the potential for reuse.

What is the legal status of the data published on "data.public.lu"?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The producer of the dataset must specify the type of licenses applicable: CC0, CC-BY, or other licenses. The government encourages transfer to the public domain (CC0).

I have observed an inaccuracy, a biased comment, or advertising content.

You can report on data.public.lu any content that you consider to be contrary to the ethics of the platform by clicking on the report button and specifying the reason for the report: illegal content, content outside the scope of the platform, advertising content, etc.

The producer and his community are notified of the content reported. The content may be removed automatically if the number of reports is high or if the obvious objective of the publication is to optimise the referencing of a third party site (SEO) without providing quality data.
