<h2>This site does not display a cookie consent banner, why?</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    We are simply following the law, which says that certain audience tracking tools, properly configured to respect privacy, are exempt from prior authorization.

<p class="text-justify">
    We use <a href="https://matomo.org">Matomo</a>, a <a href="https://matomo.org/free-software/">free software</a> tool, configured to anonymise your IP address before it is recorded. It is therefore impossible to associate your visits to this site with your person.
