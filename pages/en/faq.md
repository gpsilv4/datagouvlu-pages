The mission of the Luxembourg government's Open Data project is to support the opening of public data of the State and administrations. As such, it implements and runs the open public data platform data.public.lu, which hosts datasets and registers their re-use.

## What is the purpose of open data?

Open Data aims to encourage the re-use of data beyond their primary use by the administration. By using, directly or via applications, data published on the data.public.lu platform, one can for example:

* answer questions,
* make decisions for yourself, your municipality, your association or your company,
* benefit from useful everyday services: to get around, to avoid food waste, to know the public services near your home,
* to encourage the democratic transparency of institutions and elected officials, for example: to know the use of the parliamentary reserve, the budgets of the State and local authorities, the press titles supported by the State.

Data.public.lu is intended for :

* producers of data who wish to publish them in open and reusable formats,
* reusers who can reference their work, whether it is an article, a data visualisation or an application,
* but also to any citizen, association or company, who can discover and use data.

## How to become part of the data.public.lu community?

By consulting [the portal blog](/en/posts/) you can register for the various organised events (Hackathons, conferences).

We also invite you to follow our Twitter account [@OpenDataLu](https://twitter.com/opendatalu) (platform news, announcement of new datasets).
