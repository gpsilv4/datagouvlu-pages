# Governance of the Open data project

*Last update: 14/12/2022*

The official version of this document is the [French version](/fr/pages/gouvernance/).

This document provides information on the arrangements made by the government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to govern the official Open data project at the national level.
## Legal framework
The legal framework of Open data in Luxembourg consists of the [Law of 14 September 2018 on transparent and open administration](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/09/14/a883/jo) on the one hand and the [Law of 29 November 2021 on Open data and the re-use of public sector information](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2021/11/29/a836/jo) on the other. These legal texts guarantee, with the exception of duly explained exceptions, that documents and data can be accessed and re-used.

The implementing provisions of the law of 14 September 2018 were formulated in a [Circular letter of 26 October 2018](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/lettre-circulaire-aux-departement-ministeriels-administrations-et-services-de-letat-administration-transparente-et-ouverte/) to ministerial departments, administrations and state services regarding the practical implementation of the law.

The [legislation around the INSPIRE Directive](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2010/07/26/n4/jo) is also closely linked to the Open data project.
## Actors
The governance of the official Open data project is ensured by several governmental actors, who interact regularly and informally at the different levels of the project.
### The Open data and Access to information Division
The Open data and Access to information Division of the [Information and Press Service](https://sip.gouvernement.lu/fr.html) manages the government's Open data programme by 

- contributing to the legislative process together with the [Media, Connectivity and Digital Policy Service (MCS)](https://smc.gouvernement.lu/fr.html),
- managing the [national Open data Portal](https://data.public.lu/fr/) in terms of content and interaction with the community,
- raising awareness for transparency and Open data,
- representing the national Open data programme abroad, especially vis-Ã -vis the European Commission,
- monitoring data exchanges with other national and international portals,
- training public officials on topics related to the opening and reuse of data.

In these roles, the division's staff cooperate on an ongoing basis with the [geoportal](https://geoportail.lu/en/) service and regularly exchange information with the data managers and disclosure officers of public bodies.
### The Open data strategic working group
The Open data strategic working group brings together the heads of the Information and Press Service, the [Ministry of Digitalisation](https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr.html), the [State Information Technology Centre](https://ctie.gouvernement.lu/fr.html) and the MCS. Informally, strategic reflections are carried out in order to coordinate Open data activities with the government's other digital programmes and activities.
### Disclosure officers
The [Transparent and Open Government Act of 14 September 2018](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/09/14/a883/jo) provides for the function of disclosure officers, who act as a link between the applicant for documents and the body to which the request relates. They are also responsible for publishing documents on the Open data Portal.
### The Geoportal Service
The [geoportal](https://geoportail.lu/en/) service operates the [national Open data portal](https://data.public.lu/fr/) and ensures its daily operation and technical availability. It also operates and manages the [Luxembourg INSPIRE portal](https://catalog.inspire.geoportail.lu/) which displays and offers national geodata within the framework of the INSPIRE Directive, which are also offered as public Open data.
### The managers of the Digital Luxembourg programme
The [Digital Luxembourg](https://digital-luxembourg.public.lu/) governmental programme, led by the MCS, is a central driver in the digital transformation of the country. It is closely linked to the Open data programme, in particular with the organisation of promotional events and hackathons.
## Related platforms linked to the Open data portal
The [national Open data Portal](https://data.public.lu/fr/) collaborates at the international level in order to increase the visibility of Luxembourg data, and at the national level in order to provide a central national platform giving access to all available Open data. Among the partner platforms we can mention:
